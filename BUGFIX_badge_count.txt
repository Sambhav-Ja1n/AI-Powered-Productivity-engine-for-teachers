Quick fix applied for KeyError: 'badge_count'

ISSUE:
- Line 747 in app.py was accessing profile['badge_count'] directly
- This caused KeyError when the key was missing

FIXES APPLIED:
1. app.py line 744-747: Changed profile['total_points'] to profile.get('total_points', 0)
2. app.py line 747: Changed profile['badge_count'] to profile.get('badge_count', 0)
3. scheduling_rewards.py line 327: Added 'badge_count': 0 to error return dict

TESTING:
Run the app again - the error should be resolved.
All metrics now have safe fallbacks with default value of 0.
